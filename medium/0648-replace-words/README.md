# Replace Words

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word derivative. For example, when the root "help" is followed by the word "ful", we can form a derivative "helpful".

Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the derivatives in the sentence with the root forming it. If a derivative can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.

Return the sentence after the replacement.

 
Example 1:

Input: dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"


Example 2:

Input: dictionary = ["a","b","c"], sentence = "aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs"
Output: "a a b c"


 
Constraints:


	1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000
	1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 100
	dictionary[i] consists of only lower-case letters.
	1 <= sentence.length <= 106
	sentence consists of only lower-case letters and spaces.
	The number of words in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]
	The length of each word in sentence is in the range [1, 1000]
	Every two consecutive words in sentence will be separated by exactly one space.
	sentence does not have leading or trailing spaces.

            String root = word.substring(0, l);
            if (st.contains(root)) {
                return root;
            }

        Set<String> st = new HashSet<>(dictionary);
        
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        String[] words = sentence.split(" ");
        
        for (String word : words) {
            result.append(findRoot(word, st)).append(" ");
        }
        
        // Remove the trailing space
        return result.toString().trim();
