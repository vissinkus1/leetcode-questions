# Rotate Array

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]


Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]


 
Constraints:


	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
	0 <= k <= 105

```java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        k = k % n; // handle cases where k > n

        // Step 1: Reverse entire array
        reverse(nums, 0, n - 1);
        // Step 2: Reverse first k elements
        reverse(nums, 0, k - 1);
        // Step 3: Reverse remaining elements
        reverse(nums, k, n - 1);
    }

    private void reverse(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            int temp = nums[start];
            nums[start] = nums[end];
            nums[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
