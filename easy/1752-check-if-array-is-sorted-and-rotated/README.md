# Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array nums, return true if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, return false.

There may be duplicates in the original array.

Note: An array A rotated by x positions results in an array B of the same length such that B[i] == A[(i+x) % A.length] for every valid index i.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 2 positions to begin on the element of value 3: [3,4,5,1,2].


Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no sorted array once rotated that can make nums.


Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: [1,2,3] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 0 positions (i.e. no rotation) to make nums.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= nums.length <= 100
	1 <= nums[i] <= 100

        int count = 0;
        int n = nums.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[(i + 1) % n]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count <= 1;
    }
}
