# Number of 1 Bits

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

 
Example 1:


Input: n = 11

Output: 3

Explanation:

The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.


Example 2:


Input: n = 128

Output: 1

Explanation:

The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.


Example 3:


Input: n = 2147483645

Output: 30

Explanation:

The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= n <= 231 - 1


 
Follow up: If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

## Solution

**Language:** Java  
**Runtime:** 0 ms (beats 100.00%)  
**Memory:** 41.7 MB (beats 99.42%)

```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            count++;
            n &= (n - 1);  // clear the lowest set bit
        }
        return count;
    }
}

```
